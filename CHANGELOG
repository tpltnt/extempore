==============
Extempore 0.60
==============

Major changes:
	* add xtlang "compiler cache" (see runtime/llvmti.xtm)
	* add MCJIT support (-DEXT_MCJIT), on by default
	* update LLVM to 3.7
	* remove OpenGL bindings from extempore binary (use glfw for
	context management instead)
	* refactor graphics pipeline - gl.xtm and gl-compatibility.xtm
	replace opengl.xtm, graphics-pipeline.xtm replaces shaders.xtm
	* add cmake build/install option
	* replace --runtime option with --sharedir, which should point to
	the top-level extempore directory (--runtime is kept in as an
	alias for --sharedir, although it points one level higher than it
	did previously)

Minor changes:
	* rename code.ir to init.ll
	* add docstrings for bind-{val,poly,type,alias}
	* improved inline documentation: rich docstrings
	* change bind-val for number types to automatically wrap 'value'
	expressions in a call-as-xtlang
	* change AOT-compilation artefact location to libs/aot-cache
	* add portmidi lib bindings
	* add portaudio lib bindings
	* add nanovg lib bindings for hardware-accelerated 2D graphics,
	deprecate shivavg
	* change auto-compiled type dataconstructors: now, the default
	zalloc constructor is TypeName_z, which is bind-poly'd to TypeName
	* add bind-dylib macro, which automatically sets the
	variable *impc:aot:current-load-dylib-info*
	* bring PCRE in-tree, remove libpcre.a as a static dependency

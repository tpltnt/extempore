What's possible with Extempore?
===============================

Real-time DSP
-------------

Make your own DSP signal chain. `Start low-level`_ (with unit
generators, envelopes, LFOs, etc.) and `build whatever abstractions take
your fancy`_. You can even build Extempore 'instruments' which can be
played like soft synths (here's a simple and And because it's all
dynamically compiled, if things aren't working for you you can dig into
the source and change things on the fly :)

The ``examples/core/audio_101.xtm`` example file is a good place to
start for this sort of thing.

Higher-level (note based) audio sequencing
------------------------------------------

If writing raw bits to the sound card isn't your cup of tea, then
there's a '`instrument`_' (note-level) audio framework in Extempore as
well. You can `load an instrument`_, `trigger sounds using the familiar
pitch/velocity/duration arguments`_, and build `complex rhythmic and
harmonic patterns`_ (this type of musical coding will be `familiar to
Impromptu users`_).

.. _familiar to Impromptu users: 2012-10-15-extempore-for-impromptu-users.org

Apart from the aforelinked blog posts, the
``examples/core/polysynth.xtm`` example file is a good place to start
for this type of musical interaction. There aren't a heap of preset
instruments available currently, but more will be added as development
continues.

It's important to point out that there's nothing forcing you to choose
between these high-level and low-level music making approaches. Mixing
Scheme and xtlang code is the whole point of Extempore---so pick whichever
approach is the best fit for what you're trying to achieve.

Graphics processing
-------------------

This 'philosophy' document doesn't cover it, but Extempore also has
support for working with graphics. Both 2D (via `nanovg`_) and 3D (via
`OpenGL`_) graphics are supported, and again everything can be tweaked
on the fly.

There are a few OpenGL examples in ``examples/external/`` which might be
of interest for those who want to get started with graphics in
Extempore.

Working with external C libraries
---------------------------------

If there's a particular C library that you'd like to explore in a more
dynamic way than is possible with a statically compiled binary, then you
can `create xtlang bindings for the library`_, load it at runtime and
away you go. This could be used, for instance, to add OpenCV image
processing to a computer-vision based program, or to leverage GStreamer
for playback and remixing of video content in real-time.

If you've got the compiled library and the header file (so that you can
determine the types/function signatures of the library's functions), you
can bind it on the fly and add it into the live programming loop. Check
out the ``libs/external`` directory to see how it's done.

And much moreâ€¦

I'm sure you can think of a way to leverage Extempore that I haven't
even thought of :)

How do I start?
---------------

Extempore works on `Windows 7`_, `OSX and Linux`_, and you can `interact
with the compiler`_ using any client that can write strings to a TCP
port. Having said that, there's an `Emacs major mode`_, `a vim plugin`_,
and a `Sublime Text 2 plugin`_ in the ``extras`` directory, which all
make the programming/debugging experience a bit nicer than echoing
strings to a port using ``netcat``. But hey, whatever floats your boat.

There's `a bunch more documentation`_ on this blog, as well as the
project's `github project page`_. There are some examples in the
``examples`` subdirectory which are a great way to start off. And
finally, because it's open source, if you really want to see how it
works you can examine the source for yourself :)
